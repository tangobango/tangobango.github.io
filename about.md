Hey everyone, I'm Tami!  Here's some quick facts about me:

* I've been a video game producer for 12 years at places like Zynga, Riot Games, Playdom, Disney, PopCap, and more.
* I have the cutest 4 year old son named Henry.
* I live with my son, my partner Kevin, and our American Bulldog/Boxer puppy named Wrex
* I'm enrolled in Launch School to learn software engineering the slow (correct) way.
* Traditional college was never for me, I tried several majors including Nursing but accidentally fell into games out of passion.
