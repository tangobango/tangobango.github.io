## Glossary

- Echo: Sends text to the CLI's output
- pwd: Show where you are in the file system
- cd: change directories
- ls: list all files in a current directory
- man: manual
- touch: create a new file
- mkdir: make a new folder
- mv: move or rename

## Things I didn't know!

- You can group arguments together. So instead of doing -l -a -h you can do -lah.
- Using Cloud9 for terminal stuff is great, because you can see a pane of the file system on the left so making new files & changing directories is really easy.
